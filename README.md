# SPAM-FILTER-AND-FAKE-USER-DETECTION-ON-SOCIAL-MEDIA
Social networking sites involve millions of users worldwide. User communication 
with these social networking sites, such as Twitter and Facebook has a huge impact
and sometimes unpleasant consequences for everyday life. Prominent social 
networking sites have become a platform for reckless activists to spread large 
numbers of irrational and bizarre information. For example, Twitter has become 
one of the most widely used platforms of all time and therefore allows for an 
inaccessible amount of spam. False users send unwanted tweets to users to promote
services or websites that do not only affect legitimate users and disrupt the use of 
the services.it has been used for political battles which has also give risen to deep 
fakes , bots etc. To counter such activity , we hope it to be solved to some extent 
from this project.
